                    <p>OpenAI's free chatbot tool, ChatGPT, initiated a wave of interest in generative AI technology after its public<br> 
                        release in 2022. This type of AI could affect areas of business that rely on chatbots, such as contact centers.<br>
                         For decades, chatbots have let contact center managers reduce operational costs and offer 24/7 service. <br>

                    <p><b>BOS Center Private Limited Cancellation and Refund
                        Policy:</b><br>
                        BOS Center Private Limited (BOS Center) provides a number of products & services. This policy
                        outlines the terms for cancellation and refunds for our products & services.<br>
                        <b>Warranties</b><br>
                        BOS Center offers a 2-day limited warranty on its software products. This warranty covers
                        defects discovered in functionality within 2 days of product activation. If a defect is identified
                        during this period, BOS Center will, at its sole discretion, resolve the product defect.
<br>
                        <b>Cancellation and Refunds</b><br>

                        Before Project Start: If clients wish to request cancellation of products & services provided by
                        BOS Center Private Limited within 2 days of signing the agreement. Cancellation requests must
                        be submitted in writing via email to the designated contact person at BOS Center Private Limited.
                        Upon receiving a cancellation request, BOS Center Private Limited will review the request and
                        process it within a reasonable time frame typically within 30 days and you will receive a full
                        refund.<br>

                        After Project Start: Due to the customized nature of our products & services, no refunds are
                        permitted once a project has begun and a formal agreement has been signed by both parties.
                        Any cancellation requests made after 2 days will not be permitted, and clients will be liable for
                        the full payment as per the signed agreement.<br>
                        Warranty Claims: For software products, if you discover a defect within the 2-day warranty
                        period, please contact BOS Center support immediately. We will work diligently to resolve the
                        issue. If the issue cannot be resolved, BOS Center will, at its sole discretion, resolve the defect.<br>

                        <b>Exceptions</b><br>
                        BOS Center Private Limited reserves the right to deny cancellation or refund requests in cases
                        where:
                        The client has violated the terms and conditions of the agreement.
                        The product has been modified or tampered with by the client or any third party.
                        The issues arise due to factors beyond the control of BOS Center Private Limited, such as
                        changes in government regulations.<br>
                        <b>Dispute Resolution</b> <br>

                        BOS Center's maximum liability, under any circumstance, for any products & services offered,
                        shall be limited to the total amount received from the customer for availing of those services.
